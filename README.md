## Can't find your device?
Well, enter your model number at [Samsung Mobile Open Source](https://opensource.samsung.com/uploadList?menuItem=mobile&classification1=mobile_phone). If can't find the sources for your device, create an inquiry at [Inquiry Form](https://opensource.samsung.com/requestInquiry) since they are good people and _usually_ answer whithin a day.  
You can create an issue here if you're too shy to ask them :)
